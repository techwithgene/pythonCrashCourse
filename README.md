# Python Crash Course Exercises

This repository contains my solutions and experiments from *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes.
It's part of my Python learning journey.

## Structure
- `chapter_2/` → Variables, strings, numbers
- `chapter_3/` → Lists
- `chapter_4/` → Loops, slicing
- etc.

## Next Steps
I’ll also be adding mini-projects (scripts, automation, and tools) as I progress.
